# SD Remix Lite
Holds files associated with SD Remix Lite.

The eventual goal is to have a compiler that takes various mods, a target (NTCS or PAL), characters and stages, and create a gci to deploy.

## _Legacy_
This directory holds all the legacy files for SD Remix Lite. It doesn't have a build process, and everything has to be done manually.
