Short term:
----------
Converting the raw changes to actual individual mods in the MCM (see if they match up to included mods, or if there are updates to the mods; if there are updates, put them in the End Goal section. Also, put any unused mods included in MCM into the End Goal section as well).
Instructions in internal docs on how to create xdelta patches that are as small as they can be.
Also, include docs on how to create other types of files, like DIOS MIOS and ISO bundles.
Copy over SDRE32.ini file somewhere (maybe configs?)
Try to figure out what all the changes to the menu files are, and fill in the assets folder based on that.
Try to figure out what that random USER_LENGTH config option actually does. Maybe it's in the notes somewhere.
Move over relevant notes from personal files to this repo, particularly the PK Thunder stuff
Add SD Remix Lite to this repo
Once you have everything like this, create a new branch that is JUST the SDR 3.2.1 stuff so we can move on to the next step below

End Goal, Netplay build:
-----------------------
Make the default stage list normal, so we can just use vMelee default settings, then just have a settings code for the SDR Stage List.
SDR Stage List should have all Melee viable stages, certain stages being frozen. Maybe try and get other stages too.
Include some netplay specific codes built in
Maybe include Magus's updated 1.00 hitlag code
Probably good to have UCF and other such stuff
Probably should update to new versions of existing codes, like grab attrition and widescreen.
Other suggestions?
Look at todo list for other stuff.
Probably talk with the SDR team to get approval from whole team before making any changes.
(Maybe also make a tool for creating Debug screen changes?)
