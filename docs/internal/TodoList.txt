End Goal, Netplay build:
-----------------------
SDRE32.ini needs automatic toggles for:
    All General toggles
    All Presets
    Some obvious stuff, like neutral spawns and ko stars
    Always lagless FOD (for netplay)
After it's done, tag it as 3.2.2 or 3.2.Netplay release, and create a release set from this
Update the website with new instructions (such as new quicker xdelta methods) and new downloads.

Further later:
Change brawl airdodge button from L to definable (L or R), per player (also fix brawl airdodge)
https://smashboards.com/threads/misc-character-codes.446554/
    Special Move Master Code v3, and integration with a few of the other mods
Look at other todolists (older ones)
Try to figure out what that random USER_LENGTH config option actually does. Maybe it's in the notes somewhere.
Update build mode to cover deleted items


Codes that are incomplete or have bugs:
https://smashboards.com/threads/king-of-the-hill-friendlies-gametype.400011/
https://smashboards.com/threads/taunt-to-gain-item-v1-0.453746/

Codes that are interesting but requires testing and character changes:
https://smashboards.com/threads/brawl-style-363-deg-autolink-angle.449129/
https://smashboards.com/threads/add-frames-of-armor-knockback-resistance-to-action-states.448063/

For doing character overviews:
https://smashboards.com/threads/press-x-y-to-frame-advance.480440/

For getting compatability with slippi, look at the asm codes
https://github.com/project-slippi/slippi-ssbm-asm
https://github.com/project-slippi/slippi-ssbm-asm/blob/master/netplay.json
https://github.com/JLaferri
ASM is not available.
Next thing to try is if I can get everything to work built into the ISO so it works without any codes toggled (except for normal lag reduction, which should be fine).

SD Remix Lite
-------------
Create compiler.
Have configurable injection locations for NTSC and PAL
Have generic ACE code for NTSC or PAL
Do it like MCM: separate mods into own groups. Compile these into the direct overwrites, array overwrites, and data addresses for data overwrites.
The location on all versions are different, so depending on build target, this will have to be changed.
This should be a command line tool in C#.
Take changed character files and stages and compile the data differences to put in. Automatically add them to a list so that character loader and stage loader can work.
