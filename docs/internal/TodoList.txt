End Goal, Netplay build:
-----------------------
Finish character codes in debug menu
Save debug options in the memory card. (1.02: 8045B888 is start of name tags, goes to 80469120, end of save data)
    See https://smashboards.com/threads/shrinking-max-number-of-tags-and-tag-storage-location.405120/
    or https://smashboards.com/threads/memory-card-variables.483420/
Update Credits page, have a credits page on the website
SDRE32.ini needs automatic toggles for:
    All General toggles
    All Presets
    If custom, Most mechanics items
    Always lagless FOD (for netplay)
After it's done, tag it as 3.2.2 or 3.2.Netplay release, and create a release set from this
Update the website with new instructions (such as new quicker xdelta methods) and new downloads.

Further later:
Change brawl airdodge button from L to definable (L or R), per player
Look at other todolists (older ones)
Try to figure out what that random USER_LENGTH config option actually does. Maybe it's in the notes somewhere.
Update build mode to cover deleted items

SD Remix Lite
-------------
Create compiler.
Have configurable injection locations for NTSC and PAL
Have generic ACE code for NTSC or PAL
Do it like MCM: separate mods into own groups. Compile these into the direct overwrites, array overwrites, and data addresses for data overwrites.
The location on all versions are different, so depending on build target, this will have to be changed.
This should be a command line tool in C#.
Take changed character files and stages and compile the data differences to put in. Automatically add them to a list so that character loader and stage loader can work.
