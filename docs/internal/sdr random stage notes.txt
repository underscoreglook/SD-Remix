For SDR 3.2.1, there are two random stage lists, one for Omega and one for Alpha.
In order to create a netplay code to set these for netplay, you can use this sheet to create
the desired random stage lists for both Omega and Alpha. You can also use this for future
development as well.

This is the original code to set the random stages for singles
043D4A78 E70000B0 #Singles Stages [Magus]

Binary = Hex quick reference
0001 = 1
0010 = 2
0100 = 4
1000 = 8

With the following tables, OR the different values together and combine it with the start of the
gecko code in the title of the table. Values that are empty should be assumed to just be the
previous value vertically above it except bit shifted left.
