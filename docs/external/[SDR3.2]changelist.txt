New Debug Menu
--------------
Debug menu is now the SDR Options menu. The options include:
General Options >
	Widescreen
	Stock dependent platform colors (only works in 4 stock matches)
	Hold Start for 2.5 seconds at the results screen to force other players to press Pause.
Toggles:
	Disabled: Turns the next two menu items off. Disables all toggles inside of those menus. Changes "Ready to fight" banner color to Yellow.
	Enabled: Turns the next two menu items on. The toggles inside those menus follow what the user sets them as. Changes the "Ready to fight" banner to Green.
	Only Melee+ Enabled: Turns the next two menu items off and changes the "Melee+ Toggles >" text in the menu item to "~Melee+ Enabled". Turns off all toggles in "Other Toggles >" and enables all toggles in "Melee+ Toggles >".
Melee+ Toggles >
	Handicap (Damage Ratio, Stock/Crew): Damage Ratio is normal handicap. Stock/Crew means stocks are controlled by handicap setting. Setting handicap to Auto enables Crew Battle mode, which automatically sets the handicap to whatever the remaining stocks were in the last match.
	Ledge Invincibility (Normal, Dynamic): Dynamic means that ledge invincibility is treated like shields, where ledge invincibility is reduced each time it is used, but it recovers over time.
	Wall Bracing (Disabled, Enabled): Wall bracing allows a player going into a wall to hold left or right to brace the next grounded (non-launching) attack, so that their feet leave the ground. This combats wall infinites.
	Capped Points (Disabled, Enabled) - This uses the "Stock Match Time Limit" as the limit number (if the time limit is None, it behaves exactly as if you'd Disabled Capped Points entirely). During a timed match, if someone's number of points reach the limit, the match ends and they win. In coin battle, whoever reaches limit times 100 in coins ends the match and they win.
Other Toggles >
	Shields (Normal, Infinite)
	Tap Jump (Enabled, Disabled)
	Always Rain Bombs (Disabled, Enabled, Pokeballs): If enabled, bombs rain from the sky, like in sudden death. If Pokeballs, instead of bombs, pokeballs rain from the sky (may cause lag)
	Random Hitbox Element (Disabled, Enabled) - Makes all non-projectile hits have a random element.
Credits >
	The credits for SD Remix 3.2
Debug Mode >
	This is a parsed down version of the old Debug Menu. It's got Dairantou, rule select, Global Data Edit, DBLevel (so you can turn on hitboxes and frame by frame among other things), and Publicity on/off).
